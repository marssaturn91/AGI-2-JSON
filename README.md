# AGI-2-JSON
Utility to convert AGI (Adventure Game Interpreter) Resources into a text format for version control

Binary files are often difficult to work with when using version control. Many systems will duplicate the entire binary file for each commit, causing the repo to grow rapidly. This utility will be tailored specifically for converting AGI games' resources into a text format for storage in any version control system. This is useful for a team of multiple people working on an AGI project. This utility will also support converting any generic binary file into a JSON and back.

This tool will be written in Perl for portability.
